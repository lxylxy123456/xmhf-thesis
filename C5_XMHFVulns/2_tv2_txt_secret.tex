\section{TrustVisor Vulnerability 2: Intel TXT Secret Setting}
\label{sec:vuln_xmhf_tv_txt_secret}

In DRTM, software can set the TXT.CMD.SECRETS flag to indicate that memory contains secret value. When this flag is set and Intel TXT shutdown happens, the hardware clears the memory to protect secrets \cite{intel_txt}.

TrustVisor must ensure the memory secrecy of PALs. However, we find that when DRTM is enabled, TrustVisor fails to set the TXT.CMD.SECRETS flag. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can register a PAL and then restart the machine without unregistering the PAL. As the memory does not change after the machine restarts, the attacker can boot a malicious OS and dump the memory, which contains the secret memory of the PAL.

To fix this vulnerability, we set the TXT.CMD.SECRETS flag during TrustVisor's initialization.
