\chapter{TrustVisor Vulnerabilities}
\label{sec:vulnerabilities_xmhf_tv}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bg_tv}, TrustVisor is a micro-hypervisor ported to run on XMHF \cite{vasudevan2013design}. XMHF version 6.1.0 provides TrustVisor as an example hypapp. During the development of \XMHF64, we find six security vulnerabilities in TrustVisor when running as a hypapp in XMHF.\footnote{The vulnerabilities we find may or may not apply before TrustVisor is ported to run in XMHF, i.e., when TrustVisor runs as a standalone micro-hypervisor.} These vulnerabilities are fixed in \XMHF64, and we backport these fixes to XMHF.

Note that the following vulnerabilities are only what we find while working on this thesis. We do not claim that XMHF, \XMHF64, and TrustVisor have no other vulnerabilities.
