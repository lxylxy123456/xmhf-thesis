\label{sec:evaluation}

We evaluate \XMHF64\footnote{During the entire evaluation, we use the \XMHF64 source code as of February 15, 2023. The source code can be retrieved from \url{https://github.com/lxylxy123456/uberxmhf/tree/f6c71ded5c1541a6339614c5bad046c29671688d}.} through three dimensions. First, we measure the size of its code base. Second, we assess its compatibility by listing hardware and rich OS/Apps it supports. Third, we measure its performance through benchmarking.

When evaluating \XMHF64's performance, we first compile it in 32-bit and compare its performance with XMHF.\footnote{During the entire evaluation, we use XMHF version 6.1.0. The source code can be retrieved from \url{https://github.com/uberspark/uberxmhf/tree/3cd28bfe565221a6073950de4a8da9b61e10614e}.} Then, we measure the performance of new features in \XMHF64, including 64-bit support and virtualizing the hardware virtualization extension.
