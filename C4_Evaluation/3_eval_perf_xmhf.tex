\section{Performance Compared to XMHF}
\label{sec:evaluation_perf_xmhf}

We compare the performance of \XMHF64 with XMHF to see whether \XMHF64 introduces overhead to the system. To measure the performance, we benchmark the rich OS/Apps and TrustVisor PALs. When applicable, we use the performance of bare metal as the baseline.

To ensure fairness, we compile both XMHF and \XMHF64 in 32-bit mode. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:impl_performance}, XMHF does not support optimization, but \XMHF64 allows the user to enable compiler optimization with GCC's O3 optimization. Thus, we separately report the performance of \XMHF64 with and without optimization.

We run all experiments on an HP EliteBook 2540p with a quad-core i5-540M CPU running at 2.53 GHz. This machine has 4 GiB of memory and an HDD. We use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with kernel version 3.2.0-150 (32-bit) as the rich OS. This configuration is known to be supported by both XMHF and \XMHF64. Swapping is disabled in the rich OS to accurately measure the performance of memory.

\subsection{Rich OS/Apps Benchmarks}
\label{sec:evaluation_perf_xmhf_os}

To determine \XMHF64's efficiency, we benchmark the rich OS/Apps in \XMHF64. We use sysbench \cite{kopytov2020sysbench} to measure CPU and memory performance. We use IOzone \cite{norcott2003iozone} to measure file IO performance.

\end{figure}

The benchmark results are shown in \ref{fig:sysbench_ubuntu}. We can see that the performance of XMHF and \XMHF64 is close. For all benchmarks, XMHF and \XMHF64 achieve 98\%--100\% native performance.

\subsection{TrustVisor Benchmarks}
\label{sec:evaluation_perf_xmhf_tv}

We design a custom microbenchmark to measure the efficiency of TrustVisor. The benchmark measures the average time TrustVisor takes to perform the four types of events during PALs' life cycle, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bg_tv}: registration, invocation, termination, and unregistration. We run the benchmark on XMHF and \XMHF64 and compare the performance.

	\label{tab:palbench_ubuntu}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

The benchmark results are shown in \ref{tab:palbench_ubuntu}. The performance of XMHF and \XMHF64 without optimization is close to each other. When compiled with O3 optimization, \XMHF64 achieves a significant speedup of more than 150\%.
