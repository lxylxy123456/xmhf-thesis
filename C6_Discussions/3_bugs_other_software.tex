\section{Bugs in Other Software}
\label{sec:discussion_bugs_in_related_software}

We find multiple bugs in other software, such as compilers and general-purpose hypervisors. Additionally, we discover a few typos in hardware manuals. However, most of these bugs cause compatibility issues that only arise in uncommon scenarios and, to our knowledge, do not have security implications. For example, we find that KVM cannot run some L2 guests we develop correctly. Nevertheless, this bug does not affect widely used guest operating systems such as Windows and Linux.

Appendix~\ref{app:appendix_reported_bugs} contains a list of the bugs we report, and some of them have already been fixed by the maintainers.
