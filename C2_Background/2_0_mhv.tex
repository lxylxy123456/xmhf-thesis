\section{Micro-Hypervisor}
\label{sec:bg_mhv}

Micro-hypervisors run underneath commodity operating systems and applications, and virtualize CPU and memory to achieve memory separation. Micro-hypervisors are fundamentally different from hypervisors because micro-hypervisors do not virtualize I/O devices. Due to their small size and limited features, micro-hypervisors have small trusted computing bases (TCBs) and simple designs. Thus, micro-hypervisors can be formally verified.
